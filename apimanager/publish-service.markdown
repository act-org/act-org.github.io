When a new API is defined it is in a default lifecycle state of "Created".

![Created](img/publish-service-created.png "Created")

when the API is moved to a "Published" state it will become available in the API store for consumers to subscribe to it.

As we can see, API Manager maintains the lifecycle history of the API including additional state transitions, e.g. deprecated, retired and blocked.
