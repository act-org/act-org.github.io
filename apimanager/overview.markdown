# Overview
As part of the move to WSO2 [API Manager](http://wso2.com/products/api-manager/) there are several elements to consider. We will make the distinction between **services** that are registered and published and **APIs** that are managed which expose access to them. 

## Publisher/Service Provider

Software teams manage and publish services that will be accessed  

### [JWT: Identifying the Consumer](jwt)

## Store/Service Consumer

Application teams that need access to published services will visit a store where they can register the application and subscribe to services.
